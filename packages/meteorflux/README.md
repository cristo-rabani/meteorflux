# MeteorFlux - a reactive Flux framework

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/worona/meteorflux.svg?branch=devel)](https://travis-ci.org/worona/meteorflux) - [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/worona/meteorflux](https://badges.gitter.im/worona/meteorflux.svg)](https://gitter.im/worona/meteorflux?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

*MeteorFlux was created by [@luisherranz](https://github.com/LuisHerranz) from [@worona](https://github.com/worona) but it's not maintained anymore due to the deprecation of Blaze and Tracker in Meteor. We are working in another, similar tool but integrated with React and Mobservable instead.*
